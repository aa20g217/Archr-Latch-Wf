# Archr-Latch-Wf
 ArchR is a full-featured software suite for the analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. Latch supports visualizing UMAPs from scATAC-seq data as well as peak browser tracks. In ArchR, embeddings, such as Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) are used to visualize single cells in reduced dimension space. UMAP is designed to preserve both the local and most of the global structure in the data. Peak browser tracks are genome-track level visualizations of chromatin accessibility observed within groups of cells.
